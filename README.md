# Generic Development Environment
A simple virtualized development environment for your local machine

## Motive
During development, there are a lot of tools I need to install such as MySQL, Jenkins, Node, Python, and many more. Because of this, it's hard to keep track of the changes made to the system, especially undoing those changes. As such, I decided to virtualize my development environment which I can easily dispose of while my system is organized

## Prerequisites
You need the following tools installed before using the environment:
* **Docker**
* **Git** *(optional)*

## Directory Structure
| Folder Name | Folder Description |
| :---------: | :----------------- |
| [images](./images/) | Contains the docker images |

## Getting Started
To start using the environment:
1. Download this repository to your local machine. Alternatively, clone this repository to your local machine using **Git**
